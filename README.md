# Basic Browser JavaScript - Donut Maker
###### A tribute to [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/)

[Donut Maker Requirements](https://wecancodeit-materials.netlify.app/exercises/mastery/cookie-click-counter-calamity/)

All requirements met, PLUS a bonus feature: the Sprinkle Booster!! Whenever your auto-clicker count is divisible by 5, you can click the Sprinkle Booster button for a randomized boost of donuts!

In future iterations, I'd work to make additional features, and boost the price of existing auto-clicker and donut-multiplier features to increase the difficulty of the game. 

I'd also like to add sound effects to various clicks and boosters.
